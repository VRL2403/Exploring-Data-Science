    "## Generators\n",
    "Generators give you lazy evaluation. You use them by iterating over them: either explicitly with 'for' or implicitly, by passing it to any function or construct that iterates.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of generators returning multiple items like they're returning a list — instead of returning them all at once, however, they return them one-by-one. The generator function is paused until the next item is requested. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. For large numbers/data crunching, you can use libraries like Numpy, which gracefully handles memory management.\n",
    "2. Don't use + for generating long strings — In Python, str is immutable, so the left and right strings have to be copied into the new string for every pair of concatenations. If you concatenate four strings of length 10, you'll be copying (10+10) + ((10+10)+10) + (((10+10)+10)+10) = 90 characters instead of just 40 characters. Things get quadratically worse as the number and size of the string increases. Java optimizes this case by transforming the series of concatenations to use StringBuilder some of the time , but CPython doesn't.\n",
    "Therefore, it's advised to use .format or % syntax (however, they are slightly slower than + for short strings). Or better, if already you've contents available in the form of an iterable object, then use ''.join(iterable_object) which is much faster.\n",
    "If you can't choose between .format and %, check out this interesting StackOverflow thread."
